AUTHORS:Kareem Ahmed
USER INSTRUCTIONS:
Unfortuatly i have had some issues with getting the program to run in command prompt. But it works completely in BlueJ with no issues and it works and an jar exucatable file
except for the file maniuplation parts. 

To Run in BlueJ right click the Main class and press void main(String args[]) 

File manipulation 
the programs saves all the results of extra routes into a file called "Saving.txt" so that is where the info will go when you press save route 

to retrieve route the program reads in a certain way it goes like this

31Cherry,Philly,Holm,;21Chelt,;

so the numbers refer to the stations like this 
0 = Leicester
1 = Loughborough 
2 = Nottingham 
3 = Derby 
4 = York 

the first number refers to the first station that is picked and the second to the second

after the number you have the names of the extra stations which are split up with commas.
the end of a certain route is shown with the use of a semi colon.
